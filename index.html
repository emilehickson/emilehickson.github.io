                <br>
                <p class="lead">Ideas about building a pool robot</p><br>
                <p>According to the FIDE's elo rankings, Grandmaster Garry Kasparov is the second best chess player of all time. He is also the first Grandmaster to be defeated by a computer. In 1996, IBM's Deep Blue computer beat him in one game before Garry went on to win the match. Just one year later after major updates to IBM's computer, it finally managed to beat him outright.
<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly decoding a game like chess and teaching a computer hundreds of thousands of moves is no mean feat. One of the reasons why there are so many permutations in a game of chess is because there are so meany different moves that can be made and no matter what is played, the opponent must also make a move until victory for one player is clear. To put it extremely, the current world number-one Magnus Olson can't beat a complete novice without the novice at least making two or three moves. Every time the opponent makes a move, the computer has to at least consider that move before deciding on what to do itself. After just seven moves, there are over ten million total possible arrangements on a board.
<br>
<br>
This is not the case in pool, where a player can clear a whole table off the break without his opponent ever touching the table. It's a very fair assumption to say that if a ball is aligned with a pocket - cushion bounces included - a robot will pot the ball every single time, because it's just a problem of geometry that it can solve with far more accuracy and speed than any human. So essentially if you wanted to get a robot to beat a human at pool, it only has to figure out the order in which to pot eight balls. According to Deep Blue's documentation, on average the computer was always thinking seven or eight steps ahead. Our retail computers today are much more powerful than Deep Blue and we would have no problem looking for computing power to simulate pool games. Unfortunately, trying to simulate a game of pool can become very complex very quickly because some shots a far more complicated than others, such as the break or being snookered.

                <p class="lead">The break</p>
<p>On a computer-generated pool table, the break is a chaotic simulation of kinetic energy in all its beauty. Though a little heavy-loaded on a processor, the robot can break to heavily favor himself in accomplishing his task. I dare say a perfect break where you pot all your balls followed by the black and you leave everything else on the table is possible, but it could probably be proven mathematically possible. In the real world this certainly isn't possible, however with machine learning you could let a computer teach itself how breaks behave and over time more favourable breaks.<br>
    The only situation in which the robot loses is when the human goes first and then clears the table from the break. This wouldn't happen in professional pool due to the way to the breaker is chosen, but this would always be the case in amateur matches where the breaker is decided by a coin toss or an amicable "the challenger breaks".

                <p class="lead">Machine learning</p>
<p>The biggest reason why IBM's whole family of chess computers from the nighties were so crap was due to their software implementation. They literally brute-force hardcoded hundreds of thousands of different situations into a library for the computer to call upon depending on the opponent's move. This is a huge waste of memory used up to store data likely to never be called upon. It's also really slow and very time consuming to write up. They even got other chess Grandmasters to help them write all this code.<br>
    Thankfully today we have computers that can teach themselves almost anything. Google's DeepMind computer has figured out how to master fourty-nine Atari video games without even being told the rules of the games. In a very short amount of time it figured out the mechanics of winning in each game and then set out to win as much as possible. Using the same ideas, you could feed data from thousands of Grandmaster chess matches into the program as training data, and it would literaly, from scratch, figure out the rules of chess and then teach itself to beat Grandmasters. That's far quicker and far more efficient.<br><br>
    How does this apply to building an awesome pool robot you ask? Using once again the same ideas as Google's DeepMind project you could effectively feed enough training data into a pool robot so that it could learn the rules of the game. The most advanced uses of machine learning today involve computers teaching themselves the laws of physics after watching video of water and gas simulations. <br><br>
    Indeed a computer could teach itself the physics of pool balls and the rules of the game. However we could skip these intensive steps by implementing an already-written rule book and physics engine purposefully written for billiards called <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/billiards/FastFiz/main.html" target="_blank">FastFiz</a>.

    <p class="lead">Building a robot for the real world</p>
<p>All we have left to do now is build a robot and make it play pool. The transition from a virtual table to a physical one ought to be fairly straight forward, but not without its difficulties. What does the robot look like? The best implementation of a robot that I've seen looks like a big mechanical arm planted next to the side of the table with a piston mechanism as its hand, used to drive the end of a cue into the balls.<br><br>
   How can the robot 'see' the table? The best option is a high quality colour camera that sits above the pool table that can observe the whole game and see where all the balls are positioned. The robot would translate the video feed into coordinate geometry and asign an x,y position for each ball. The one assumption made to really simplify the work load here is that the game isn't played on the z-axis. Indeed flying balls is more in the realm of amateur pool and doesn't occur in professional pool; it's certainly not needed to finish a game of pool. You would have to tell the robot to put a cap on the force it's allowed to hit the balls with so they don't go flying on impact.<br><br>
    
    Many people have tried to build this kind of robot before but the implementation always seems rushed or over-complicated. Many of them can only hit a few balls lined up for them and can't even finish a game. Some of them use multiple cameras to track the balls in an over-complicated three-dimensional space. Most of them have two mechanical arms that hold the cue like a human and track where the tip of the cue is with a seperate camera. This implementation is so slow to move, it would make the game really long and boring. Long story short, there is room for improvement.
