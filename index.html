                <p class="lead">Ideas about building a pool robot</p><br>
                <p>According to the FIDE highest-achieved rating list, Grandmaster Garry Kasparov is the second best chess player of all time. He is also the first Grandmaster to be defeated by a computer. In 1996, IBM's Deep Blue computer beat him in one game before Garry went on to win the match. Just one year later after major updates to IBM's computer, it finally managed to beat him outright.

Undoubtedly decoding a game like chess and teaching a computer hundreds of thousands of moves is no mean feat. One of the reasons why there are so many permutations in a game of chess is because there are so meany different moves that can be made and no matter what is played, the opponent must also make a move until victory for one player is clear. To put it extremely, the current world number-one Magnus Olson can't beat a complete novice without the novice at least making two or three moves. Every time the opponent makes a move, the computer has to at least consider that move before deciding on what to do itself. After just seven moves, there are over ten million total possible arrangements on a board.
<br>
<br>
This is not the case in pool, where a player can clear a whole table off the break without his opponent ever touching the table. It's a very fair assumption to say that if a ball is aligned with a pocket - cushion bounces included - a robot will pot the ball every single time, because it's just a problem of geometry that it can solve with far more accuracy and speed than any human. So essentially if you wanted to get a robot to beat a human at pool, it only has to figure out the order in which to pot eight balls. According to Deep Blue's documentation, on average the computer was always thinking seven or eight steps ahead. Our retail computers today are much more powerful than Deep Blue and we would have no problem looking for computing power to simulate pool games.
<br>
<br>
Unfortuneately, trying to simulate a game of pool can become very complex very quickly because some shots a far more complicated than others.

                <p class="lead">The break</p><br>
<p>On a computer-generated pool table, the break is a chaotic simulation of kinetic energy in all its beauty. Though a little heavy-loaded on a processor, the robot can break to heavily favor himself an accomplishing his task. I dare say a perfect break where you pot all your balls followed by the black and leave everything else on the table is possible, but it could probably be proven mathematically.</p>
