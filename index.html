    According to the FIDE highest-achieved rating list, Grandmaster Garry Kasparov is the second best chess player of all time. He is also the first Grandmaster to be defeated by a computer. In 1996, IBM's Deep Blue computer beat him in one game but he went on to win the match. Just one year later after major updates to IBM's computer, it finally managed to beat him.<br>
<br>
    Undoubtedly decoding a game like chess and teaching a computer hundreds of thousands of moves is no mean feat. One of the reasons why there are so many permutations in a game of chess is because no matter what is played, the opponent must also make a move until victory for one player is clear. To put it extremely, the current world number-one Magnus Olson can't beat a complete novice without the novice at least making two or three moves. Every time the opponent makes a move, the computer has to at least consider that move before deciding on what to do itself. After just 7 moves, there are over ten million total possible arrangements on a board.<br>
<br>  
    This is not the case in pool, where a player can clear a whole table off the break without his opponent ever touching the table. It's a very fair assuption to say that if a ball is aligned with a pocket - cushion bounces included - a robot will pot the ball every single time, because it's just a problem of geometry that it can solve with far more accuracy and speed than any human. So essentially if you wanted to get a robot to beat a human at pool, it only has to figure the order in which to pot 8 balls. How to deal with the break is more problematic but we'll get back to that.
